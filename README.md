Recipe shuffle is a simple app inspired by my wife's frustration with using spreadsheets to plan out multiple weeks worth of meals and shopping.

# Features
- Create a bank of recipes
- Assign recipes to days of the week based on a tag system and random assignment
- Generate a shopping list based on the assigned recipes

# Running the app locally

Recipe Shuffle was built as an angular CLI project, so it should be simple to get running:
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `ng serve`
